The main two approaches involve long-read sequencing with Nanopore technology and short-read sequencing with an Illumina machine. In the latter case, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is performed by the sequencer to amplify the library and quantify gene expression.\nIn the ideal situation, we would expect to have a doubling of each RNA strand in a linear fashion, so that each molecule is duplicated and the ratio between the expression levels of the different genes is maintained. However, this process introduces different types of errors due to factors such as the the composition of the sequence (for example high fraction of G or C) or the secondary structure, stochasticity and mutation that make it impossible to deduce the absolute gene expression, especially for low-copy genes.\nIn addition, the sequencing process involves breaking the mRNA sequence into several pieces because the machine cannot sequence a full-length genome. Thus, multiple variants may originate from the same sequence, so we may think there are several copies of the same gene, but in reality it is one broken copy. Therefore, we may infer a wrong expression level. Instead, sequencing data provides a compositional measure of gene expression, where every observation (or gene) is quantified in relation to the rest of the pool. Thus, it is essential to normalise reads from different samples when drawing between-sample comparisons.\n\n\nPart 2\nThe package with the data of interest is imported.\n\n# Import package\nlibrary(pasilla)\n\nRNA-Seq data from Drosophila melanogaster is loaded from the package.\n\n# Load data\npasCts &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \"pasilla_gene_counts.tsv\",\n                      package = \"pasilla\", mustWork = TRUE)\n\npasAnno &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \"pasilla_sample_annotation.csv\",\n                       package=\"pasilla\", mustWork = TRUE)\n\ncts &lt;- as.matrix(read.csv(pasCts, sep = \"\\t\", row.names = \"gene_id\"))\n\ncoldata &lt;- read.csv(pasAnno, row.names = 1)\ncoldata &lt;- coldata[ , c(\"condition\", \"type\")]\n\nrownames(coldata) &lt;- sub(\"fb\", \"\", rownames(coldata))\ncts &lt;- cts[, rownames(coldata)]\n\nThe matrix cts contains the gene expression data in terms of the number of reads for 14599 genes from 7 samples.\n\n# View head of counts assay\nhead(cts, 10)\n\n            treated1 treated2 treated3 untreated1 untreated2 untreated3\nFBgn0000003        0        0        1          0          0          0\nFBgn0000008      140       88       70         92        161         76\nFBgn0000014        4        0        0          5          1          0\nFBgn0000015        1        0        0          0          2          1\nFBgn0000017     6205     3072     3334       4664       8714       3564\nFBgn0000018      722      299      308        583        761        245\nFBgn0000022        0        0        0          0          1          0\nFBgn0000024       10        7        5         10         11          3\nFBgn0000028        0        1        1          0          1          0\nFBgn0000032     1698      696      757       1446       1713        615\n            untreated4\nFBgn0000003          0\nFBgn0000008         70\nFBgn0000014          0\nFBgn0000015          2\nFBgn0000017       3150\nFBgn0000018        310\nFBgn0000022          0\nFBgn0000024          3\nFBgn0000028          0\nFBgn0000032        672\n\n\nDimensions of the counts assay can be retrieved with the dim function.\n\n# Store assay dimensions\nmat_dim &lt;- dim(cts)\n# View assay dimensions\nmat_dim\n\n[1] 14599     7\n\n\nSamples differ from one another in the library size.

Instead, option (b) provide relatively little new information, as the current design already seems to identify the main frequency components rather well, and a longer duration is unlikely to find more of them.\nFrequency analysis represents a more powerful tool than time analysis to detect the oscillatory nature of biological signals. Because signals are almost always composed by several waves with different sub-frequencies and mixed up with noise, it is not practical to study their oscillatory nature in the time domain. Instead, the frequency domain allows to separate the frequency components of the signal, which can be thereby described as the sum of simple waves, such as sine and cosine functions. Therefore, it is convenient to study oscillatory behaviour with frequency analysis.\n\ncompute_powers &lt;- function(time_series) {\n  \n  powers &lt;- fft(time_series)\n  powers &lt;- as.numeric(powers * Conj(powers))[2:(1 + length(powers) / 2)]\n  norm_powers &lt;- powers / sum(powers)\n  \n  return(norm_powers)\n}\n\n\npower_mat &lt;- t(apply(circ_mat, 1, compute_powers))\nsorted_powers &lt;- sort(power_mat[ , 2], decreasing = TRUE)\nhead(sorted_powers, 10)\n\n   atxn1b       fus    nr1d2b     rdh1l  ankrd10a    phyhd1 arntl1b.1    ARNTL2 \n0.9658877 0.9575730 0.9518555 0.9505309 0.9502425 0.9459556 0.9420237 0.9276018 \n     Ldhd     aclya \n0.9251018 0.9218165 \n\n\n\nsum(is.na(sorted_powers))\n\n[1] 0\n\n\n\n\nPart 6\n\ncirc_stats &lt;- find_log_stats(circ_mat, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nThe genes are binned by similarity in library size and a z-score is calculated within each bin.

Such processes are known to be linked to the concentration of vitamin D in the body, which is produced upon exposure to sunlight. Therefore, we conclude that the found top 40 genes indeed show relevant oscillations with a period of 24 hours in relation with the circadian rhythms."
